## ABSTRACT


[1][2]In our new era PCs become our part of life for every personal and professional requirement. Majority of organizations depend on the finest possible working of their systems for correspondences, organization, mechanization, online business solutions, and so on. LAN is the best fundamental and significant PC system claimed by discrete organizations and might be utilized for interconnection of wide region systems. A LAN provides effective cost sharing of fast processing information handling gear, for example, mass stockpiling media, centralized server PCs or tiny computers and various types of printers. Asset sharing is generally similar as significant where a Local Area Network (LAN) serves as the entrance path for an Internet. In view of this, framework supervisor’s requirement professional tools to help them with the motivation of improvement of QoS and maintenance of LANs. So in our project, a LAN system is structured utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer. This project explains just how the apparatus can be used to build up a reenactment model of the Local Area Network (LAN) for College of Engineering which contains a department like Bio Technology (BT), Civil, Mechanical, ECE and EEE or any. The examination gives a knowledge into different ideas such as IP address setup, topology plan and how to send data as packets in a solitary network and for the usage of Virtual Local Area Networks to isolate the heavy traffic produced by various systems.

# First Contributions

This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.




## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"
```

replacing `<your-name>` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Where to go from here?

Congrats! You just completed the standard _fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request_ workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!

Celebrate your contribution and share it with your friends and followers by going to [web app](https://firstcontributions.github.io/#social-share).

You could join our slack team in case you need any help or have any questions. [Join slack team](https://join.slack.com/t/firstcontributors/shared_invite/zt-vchl8cde-S0KstI_jyCcGEEj7rSTQiA).

Now let's get you started with contributing to other projects. We've compiled a list of projects with easy issues you can get started on. Check out [the list of projects in the web app](https://firstcontributions.github.io/#project-list).
